					<h3> Background </h3>
					<figure class="col8">
						<h4>The Problem</h4>
						<p>Toys et Cetera is looking to communicate their message through an Improved digital shopping experience. Shoppers need a way to purchase toys and feel like they have made an informed decision.</p>

						<h4>Role</h4>
						<p>This was a mock client project as a part of General Assembly User Experience Design Immersive. As a team of four designers we conduct interviews, developed insights, mapped the user journey, and created affinity maps together.</p>
						<h4>The Client</h4>
						<p>Toys Et Cetera was founded 40 + years ago to provide educational, developmentally sound, and culturally relevant toys. They were looking to support the growth of physically, socially, and emotionally healthy children through safe toys.</p>
						<h4>Tools Used</h4>
						<p>Sketch, Illustrator, and Invision.</p>
						<h4>Time Frame</h4>
						<p> This was a ten-day design sprint. Each day started with a lecture to share help explain the UX process and .

						<h3> The Challenge </h3>
						<div class="clearfix">
							<figure class="col8">
								<h4>Initial Investigation</h4>
								<p>Toys et cetera was founded 40 + years ago as a way to:Provide educational, developmentally sound, and culturally relevant toysSupport the growth of physically, socially, and emotionally healthy childrenProvide toys that are safe.
								Initial Insight: Shoppers needed a way to connect with the store’s founding principles and goals but it is easy to get lost in the multiple characterizations of their toys and four separate navigational elements of the site.Current Website Design-The current website had 4 different navigational elements. Three separate headers and a random sidebar. They also had this section called fundamentals that randomly related to the other toys.</p>
								<br>
							</figure>
							<figure class="col6">
								<img src="images/2.png" alt="image of the Golden Circle" title="Golden Circle" class="imagewrapper">
								<h4>The Golden Circle</h4>
								<p>We discovered that through inserting charities into the flow we can beneficially expand the users that Venmo connects, by empowering more people through payments and donations. For Venmo this presented an opportunity to support philanthropy, raise brand awareness, and grow their user base.</p>
								<h4>Crowdfunding</h4>
								<p> This shows the growth in crowdfunding giving between 2012 and 2015.<a href="http://crowdexpert.com/crowdfunding-industry-statistics/">(Source)</a></p>
								<div class="imagewrapper">
									<img src="images/3.png" alt="Millenial Giving Chart" title="chart" class="imagewrapper">
									<h4>Charitable Giving Statistics</h4>
									<p> We found that, "in a survey of more than 1,500 employed millennials, 87 percent had donated money to a nonprofit in the last year, 62 percent said they had done that through a mobile platform and learned about those charities via their peers." It seemed that supporting causes through Venmo was a natural market from looking at these reports.<a href="http://cdn.trustedpartner.com/docs/library/AchieveMCON2013/MIR_2014.pdf"> (Source)</a></p>

					<h3> Research </h3>
					<div class="clearfix">
						<figure class="col8">
							<h4>Approach</h4>
							<p>We wanted to understand how the current charitable donation market is positioned as well as how people are currently donating. We also wanted to know how people are using Venmo and how charitable organizations are colllecting money. So we approached our research through identifying several channels: We did a competitive market analysis, and an anaylsis of other chartiable donation platforms. Additionally we looked at companies that are rating charities and companies that are assigning credibility through the charities they promote. Finally we conducted interviews with Venmo users, donors, and charities to gain insights about their process.</p>
						</figure>
					</div>
					<div class="clearfix">
						<figure class="col2">
							<div class="columntext">
								<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
								<p>We looked at three of the top competitors and analyzed who their users were, including Venmo’s parent company: Paypal. We learned that Venmo users are social spenders. Social spenders are people who occasionally spend or transfer money between friends in small amounts. We found that Venmo has a defined position in the arena of small transactions under $300.</p>
							</div>	
						</figure>
						<figure class="col5">
							<div class="imagewrapper">
								<img src="images/6.png" alt="image of abstract art" title="Brick wall" class="imagewrapper">
								<p> This model helped us understand who charities would be targeting. We believed that charities could expand their network and leverage the social nature of Venmo by tapping into the intimate relationships that connect most users.</p>

					<div class="clearfix">
						<figure class="col2">
							<div class="columntext">
								<h4>Charitable Donation Platforms</h4>
								<p>We looked at other crowdfunding platforms to understand what they are doing correctly and how they are doing it. We saw that companies like Kickstarter and GoFundMe are using social networks to attract people to their site. Additionally we saw that the social nature of these sites help entice and engage a larger user base.</p>
							</div>	
						</figure>
						<figure class="col5">
							<div class="imagewrapper">
								<img src="images/6.2.png" alt="image of abstract art" title="Brick wall" class="imagewrapper">
								<p>These platforms are the two largest crowdfunding sites. Gofundme primarily is used for informal charitable donations. Informal donations are donation between two people</p>
							</div>
						</figure>
					</div>
					<div class="clearfix">
						<figure class="col2">
							<div class="columntext">	
								<h4>Credibility</h4>
								<p> The key elements that platforms are considering is credibility. We noticed that each plaform is acting differently. But we were able to take away that trust was an important factor when determining who to donate to. These websites rate charities and their effectivness. These platforms were verifying charities via a 501 (C)(3) status and an EIN number.</p>

						<figure class="col5">

						<figure class="col5">
							<div class="imagewrapper">
								<img src="images/7.png" alt="image of abstract art" title="Brick wall" class="imagewrapper">
								<p>We conducted 9 interviews with Venmo users, occasional donors, and employees at charitable organizations. Some Venmo users were donors and some donors also worked for charities. But, we interviewed no charities that were using Venmo as a platform to collect funds.</p>

								<h4>5E Framework</h4>
								<p> To explain our findings we mapped one user journey from each group of interview groups</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Entice: How do you get interested?</li>
									<li>Enter: How do you start?</li>
									<li>Engage: What’s the process?</li>
									<li>Exit: How does it end?</li>

								<h4>Venmo User: Sean</h4>
								<p>Sean is satisfied with the current Venmo experience. For Sean, Venmo is so easy he has replaced conventional currency for transactions between friends. When hanging out with his friends he no longer has to worry about having enough cash. His trust in Venmo is based off of trust in his friendships.</p>

								<h4>Donor: Shannon</h4>
								<p>Shannon, like other donors doesn’t seek out donation opportunities on her own. She doesn’t mind making a contribution when there is an opportunity in front of her and she feels best when she is able to discern where her funds are going. Shannon seeks transparency throughout the donation process. </p>

							<h4>Charitable Organization Employee: Schoen</h4>
							<p>Schoen is the head of development at Collaboraction a local Chicago chartiy. She utilizes the social networks of current members to seek potential new donors. Gathering contact information is a priority over an initial donation. For Collaboraction furthering the relationship through engagement and involvement will lead to more sustained giving.</p>

							<h4>Comparing the Experience</h4>
							<p>By comparing the Venmo experience and the donation experience we found similarities between how people enter, engage, and exit. Interestingly the donation process provides stronger enticement then the current Venmo expereince, as well as charities provide a stronger extension of the relationship with their users.</p>

							<h4>The Ideal Donor Experience</h4>

							<h4>The Ideal Charity Experience</h4>
							<br>
							<p>Setting up a charity account needs to be as simple as setting up a personal account. Charities can create their own causes based on their current fundraising effort. They can share their cause or account information to social media or prompt donors in person to donate via the Venmo app.</p>

				<h3>Design Iterations</h3>
				<div class="clearfix">
					<figure class="col8">
						<h4>Mimicking</h4>
						<p>We started our paper prototypes by mimicking the Venmo layout. Since we determined staying consistent was important we needed to get a good sense of how the app was laid out. The paper sketches gave us a great sense of the features Venmo was already using but it didnt help us test our own features because of the specificity of the icons. We started to realize small tweaks with a big impact was going to be difficult.</p>
						<h4>Building</h4>
						<p>We were able to test our weakest held assumptions regarding icons, microinteractions, and feedback for the user with our low fidelity wireframes.</p>
						<h4>Adding Clarity</h4>
						<p> Turning the low fidelity wireframes into a high fidelity prototype was a very quick process because we had to manage our icon assets up front to provide clarity during testing. This process was more about adding additional clarity than it was about solving any major design issues.</p>
						<h4>The Scenarios</h4>
						<p>We did our first round of wireframe tests with 6 people. We tested within two scenarios. One scenario was for regular Venmo users to make a donation to their favorite charity the Red Cross. The second scenario was with charitable organization employeess acting as the red cross to set up a cause to raise money for a recent tsunami.</p>

						<h4>Test Results</h4>
						<p> Our testing solved many user flow issues and provided direction in how to move forward. We struggled with with a two flow solution, and learned that if we are going to test two user flows we needed to completely seperate those flows and screens. This was probably the biggest struggle within the project and this cost us the most amount of time.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Users responded very positively to the heart badge because it was consistent with other verification badges.</li>
							<li>Users commented on the consistency of the Venmo experience, and how it was so similar to the Venmo experiences they currently know</li>
							<li>Users responded very poorly to being asked if they would like to be contacted by the charity.</li>
							<li>We had initially assumed that searching for a charity would happen within the same flow as the "search people" but without a search charity icon in the menu button people were confused on how to look for a charity.</li>

							<h4>A Second Sprint</h4>
							<p>After completing the 10 day sprint we took our prototype over to the Delta Institute to validate our research even further. We allowed charity organizers to play around with the prototype and we got feedback that showed we could stand to go through a second design sprint. The main thing these charity organizers talked about was being able to switch from their personal account to a charity Venmo account they are managing. They also asked questions about backend features and commented on how they enjoyed the bio section in the causes page.</p>
							<br>
							<h4>Additional Features</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Data report feature</li>
								<li>Group feature / charity feature integration</li>
								<li>Profile management / switching between a personal account and a charity account</li>
								<li>Personal account- causes feature</li>
								<li>Bio section for all Venmo profiles</li> 
							</ul>

							<h4>Additional Questions</h4>
							<p>As we wrapped up the project I was left with a lot of questions on how to improve our product.</p>
							<ul> 
								<li>How does a charity manager who has a personal Venmo account switch between accounts, but enable trust throughout the charities, and through the donor?</li> 
								<li>What are the analytics that charities need, and what do effective analytics look like? </li>
								<li>Can we push further a platform where we are enabling a greater sense of giving and responsibility?</li>
							</ul>
						</figure>

							<h4>Things I learned</h4>	
							<p> Beyond the questions I had I also was left a greater understanding of the UX process and where I could grow.</p>
							<ul> 
								<li>Mapping a concrete user flow is vital to speed when creating wireframes.</li>
								<li>Test as early as possible to help validate the weakest held assumptions.</li> 
								<li>Create tests that develop a scenario the user can embody, and ask open ended questions.</li>
								<li>Documentation is extremely important.</li>
							</ul>
