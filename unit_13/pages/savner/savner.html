								<h4>The Problem</h4>
								<p>Northwestern University School of Law needed a classroom to support a new teaching model, for a recent program they started. The key stakeholders had been made aware of the “flipped classroom” model and were looking to have a completely mobile room with multiple displays, 17 HDMI inputs, a classroom computer, and a wireless display option, that allowed professor to control the room independently without the explicit need of customer support.  As a team of architects, owner’s reps, general contractors, and a technology vendor we developed a plan to provide a room that displayed and showcased the mobile technology, introduced a new furniture plan to entice the students in, and introduced technology that was complex but visually simple.</p>
							</figure>
							<figure class="col8">
								<h4>Time Frame and Role</h4>
								<p>The flipped classroom project was a small section of a much larger project that involved a three story build out over one and a half years. I acted as the user experience designer, technology specialist, and owner’s representative project manager. I conducted user research, led all furniture testing, and acted as the liaison between the contractors, the architects, and the technology vendor.</p>
								<br>
								<img src="images/0.png" alt="image time frame" title="time frame" class="imagewrapper">
								<h4>Flipped Classroom explanation</h4>
								<p>The flipped classroom model is a pedagogical model in which the typical lecture and homework elements of a course are reversed. Short video lectures are viewed by students at home before the class session, while in-class time is devoted to exercises, projects, or discussions. The students are encouraged to take control of the materials and show other students.</p>

							<h3>Research</h3>
						</div>
						<figure class="col8">
							<h4>Research Approach</h4>
							<p>-	We conducted interviews, and a full product analysis of the furniture and technology within the classroom, additionally we tested our concepts and iterated often. To test the furniture, we narrowed the options down to three tables, and three chairs and had students test which options they preferred. We made modifications to our decisions based on those interviews.</p>
						</figure>
						<figure class="col6">
							<div class="columntext">
								<h4>The Limitations</h4>
								<p>This project involved many challenges and the most difficult one was the limitations of the physical space based on the universities quest for transparency and historical sensitivity. This allowed for very little wall space to hang technology and hide cords and cables. There were two walls of glass and one wall of limestone that couldn’t be tampered with as well as a poured concrete floor. Additionally, the room was 400 square feet and included a support column that made a section of the room partially inaccessible.  To succeed, we discovered we needed to make permanent decisions up front that allowed flexible technology and furniture decisions later.</p>
							</div>	
						</figure>
						<figure class="col6">
							<div class="columntext">
								<h4>Mobility</h4>
								<p>Agility and mobility in the room were the top priority. Ensuring that all the furniture and technology were in the space as well as ensuring up to 25 students and two teachers could comfortably fit and move around was our biggest challenge. We wanted a room that felt expansive for the occupants inside. We devised several layouts that could help us achieve this goal.</p>

								<h4>Tables and Chairs</h4>
								<p>We chose the Haworth Planes tables because of their ability to move and fold up to provide more space. We found the Izzy Capisco chair and we were intrigued by the design because it allowed the students to sit in whatever direction met their specific needs. Ultimately, we were looking for a table and chair the students could engage with and move around on.</p>

								<h4>Lecturn and Monitor Shroud</h4>
								<p>We decided on the Dewey lecturn because it was height adjustable and could fit multiple items on a single surface. This was important to law professors who are using multiple legal books, a laptop, and a cup of coffee to present to their class. -	We chose the Haworth easel because we needed a solution that could hide the wires and look clean from the back side as well as be able to disconnect from the floor inputs at a moment’s notice.</p>

							<h4>Office Managers Insights</h4>
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li>Office managers seek communinity approval before purchasing beer.</li> 
								<li>Office managers struggle with decision fatigue specifically when tasked with selecting services and amenities.</li> 
								<li>Office managers need to feel personally supported by their vendors or they will look to other options.</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<h4>Crafty Insights</h4>		
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li>Crafty built their brand through face to face relationships, and is struggling to maintain that connection.</li>
								<li>Crafty is making decisions on the fly without a cohesive strategy to guide decisions.</li>
								<li>Crafty is providing a valuable service but they are not influencing the experiences they help create.</li>

							<h4>Website</h4>
							<p>Maintaining the Crafty look and feel was important to their clients so we used Crafty's style guide as a starting point. Since existing customers enter directly into the marketplace the homepage needed to communicate the offerings to new customers. We added:</p>
							<ul class="col10">
								<li>Global dynamic search navigation.</li>
								<li>Popular categories tab bar</li>
								<li>Expanding product description on click</li>
								<li>Three step checkout process.</li>
								<li>Interactions that provide feedback</li>
								<li>Beer poll for office employees</li>
							</ul>
							<ul class="col10">		
								<li>Ability to sort by size</li>
								<li>Whitespace to aleviate decision fatigue</li>
								<li>Shopping cart that paginates at 25 items.</li>
								<li>Ability to set default preferences</li>
								<li>Repeat purchase button</li>
								<li>Ability to reserve out of stock items</li>

								<h4>Deliverables and Feedback</h4>
								<p>Working with the Crafty team was an ideal client project. They were engaged and constantly looking to support our team through providing further engagement opportunities with their clients.</p>
								<ul> 
									<li>Craftys development team is phasing our solution in over the next several weeks.</li> 
								</ul>
								<br>
								<h4>"It was such a pleasure working with you all. We are so impressed by the incredible work you all did in such a short period of time!" -Nathan Rosenstock Crafty co-founder</h4>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h4>What I Learned</h4>	
								<p>Working with a client like Crafty allowed us to provide the best possible solution because of their willingness to let us provide value. If I was to do this project over again I would:</p>
								<ul> 
									<li>Iterate earlier and faster.</li>
									<li>Testing our riskiest assumptions earlier is important to providing a well developed solution.</li>
									<li>Prompt testers to talk more and develop prototypes that allow movement through test scenarios.</li>
								</ul>
