								<h4>The Problem</h4>
								<p>Venmo a social payment app used as a mock client wanted to give users the ability to donate to causes they care about, but their users were content with the current platform. Charities needed a simple way to engage with donors but struggled to convey credibility through a social payment app. We discovered that by validating the authenticity of charities we can beneficially expand the users that Venmo connects.</p>
								<br>
								<h4>Time Frame</h4>
								<div class="imagewrapper">
									<img src="images/1_1.png" alt="image of abstract art" title="Brick wall" class="imagewrapper">
								</div>
								<p>We used an agile framework to communicate as we worked together through a ten-day sprint. As a team of four designers we conduct interviews, developed insights, mapped the user journey, and created affinity maps together. I led the ideation, wire framing, creation of high-fidelity mockups, and usability testing portions of the project.</p>
								<br>
								<h4>Charitable Giving Statistics</h4>
								<p>The clear majority of Venmo users were millennials using Venmo to settle small balances between friends. Additionally, most millennials who had donated to charities did so from mobile platforms. They learned about those charities via their peers.<a href="http://cdn.trustedpartner.com/docs/library/AchieveMCON2013/MIR_2014.pdf">(Millenial Giving).</a> So a social payment application between friends such as Venmo was primed to help make the donation connection.<a href="https://www.blackbaud.com/nonprofit-resources/generational-giving-report-infographic">(Generational Giving Statistics)</a><a href="http://crowdexpert.com/crowdfunding-industry-statistics/">(Crowdfunding Industry Statistics)</a></p>

						</div>
						<div class="clearfix">
							<figure class="col8">
								<h4>Research Approach</h4>
								<p>We wanted to understand the current ecosystem surrounding Venmo, charitable organizations, and charitable giving. We approached our research through identifying several channels: We did a competitive market analysis, an analysis of other charitable donation platforms and a review of companies that are rating and assigning credibility to charitable organizations. We interviewed Venmo users, charitable donors, and charitable organizations to gain insights about their process of spending and collecting money.</p>
							</figure>
						</div>
						<div class="clearfix">
							<figure class="col2">
								<div class="columntext">
									<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
									<p>We learned that Venmo users are social spenders who occasionally spend or transfer money between friends in small amounts under $300. We believed that charities could expand their network and leverage the social nature of Venmo by tapping into the intimate relationships that connect most users.</p>

									<h4>Charitable Donation Platforms</h4>
									<p>We looked at other crowdfunding platforms to understand who is best in class. We saw that companies like Kickstarter and GoFundMe (the two largest crowdfunding platforms) are using social networks to attract people to their site. Additionally we saw that the social nature of these sites helps to entice and engage a larger user base.</p>

Companies like Charity navigator and the Better Business Bureau rate charities and assign credibility based on the charitable organizations effectiveness.</p>

									<h4>Interview Numbers</h4>

									<p> We discovered there wasn't an overlap between charitable organizations that were using Venmo as a platform to collect funds.</p>

									<h4>Traditional Venmo User: Sean</h4>
									<a href="images/8.png">
										<img src="images/8.png" alt="image of abstract art" title="Brick wall" class="imagewrapper">

									<p>We looked at Sean's user flow because it represented a common theme of happiness within the app. Later, we knew this flow would be important to replicate as we added features.</p>
									<br>
									<h4>Traditional Charity Donor: Shannon</h4>
									<img src="images/9.png" alt="image of abstract art" title="Brick wall" class="imagewrapper">
									<p>For Shannon, donating means knowing what the cause is that she is supporting, knowing where her money will go, and knowing how she will affect change.</p>
									<br
									<h4>Charitable Organization Employee: Schoen</h4>
									<img src="images/10.png" alt="image of abstract art" title="Brick wall" class="imagewrapper">
									<p> For Collaboraction figuring out how to extend the experience is their biggest goal. In the donation world, making sure donors are engaged after their first donation is extremely important to continue the funding process.</p>

							<h3> Insights</h3>

								<div class="columntext">
									<h4>Comparing the Experience</h4>
									<p>By comparing the Venmo experience and the donation experience we found similarities between how people enter, engage, and exit. Interestingly the donation process provides stronger enticement then the current Venmo experience, as well as charities provide a stronger extension of the relationship with their users.</p>

								<div class="imagewrapper">
									<img src="images/11.png" alt="image of abstract art" title="Brick wall" class="imagewrapper">

										<h4>Venmo User Insights</h4>
										<p>We discovered that Venmo users seek convenience, value trust, and generally enjoy the Venmo experience.</p>
										<h4>Charitable Donor Insights</h4>	
										<p>We found that traditional donors find many barriers to action in the donation process. Donors were encouraged to donate when there was a level of transparency about the organization they were donating to and when they were emotionally tied to the cause or could empathize with the need.</p>
										<h4>Charitable Organization Insights</h4>
										<p>In our interviews, charitable organizations were seeking relationships with new donors sometimes over an initial donation. These organizations wanted to expand through their already built social network and were seeking new opportunities for engagement around those networks.</p>

								<h4>The Ideal Charity Experience</h4>
								<br>
								<p>Setting up a charity account needs to be as simple as setting up a personal account. Charities can create their own causes based on their current fundraising effort. They can share their cause or account information to social media or prompt donors in person to donate via the Venmo app.</p>

								<h4>Small Tweaks Big Impact</h4>
								<p>To stay consistent with the current Venmo layout our paper prototypes needed to mimic the layout exactly. The paper sketches helped us understand the features Venmo was already using but it did not help us in testing because of the specificity of the icons we were trying to implement. We started to realize small tweaks with a big impact was going to be difficult.</p>

							<h4>User Test Scenarios</h4>

								<h4>Test Results</h4>
								<p>Our usability tests solved user flow issues and provided guidance on how to remove obstacles. We struggled with a two-flow solution (when testing with charities and testing with Venmo users), and learned that if we are going to test two users flows we needed to separate those flows and screens.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Users responded very positively to the heart badge because it was consistent with other verification badges.</li>
									<li>Users commented on the consistency of the Venmo experience, and how it was similar to the Venmo experiences they currently know.</li>
									<li>Users responded very poorly to being asked if they would like to be contacted by the charity.</li>
									<li>We had initially assumed that searching for a charity would happen within the same flow as the "search people" but without a search charity icon in the menu button people were confused on how to look for a charity.</li>

							<figure class="col6">
								<h4>A Second Sprint</h4>
								<p>After completing the ten day sprint we took our prototype over to the Delta Institute to validate our assumptions further. We allowed charity organizers to play around with the prototype. We got feedback that showed a second design sprint was needed. The charity organizers discussed having the ability to switch from their own personal account to a charity account they are managing. An account switching feature would reduce barriers for the charitable organizations. We took our feedback and developed a list of additional features that would reduce barriers, increase trust, and facilitate relationships</p>
								<br>
								<h4>Additional Features</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Data report feature</li>
									<li>Group feature / charity feature integration</li>
									<li>Profile management / switching between a personal account and a charity account</li>
									<li>Personal account- causes feature</li>
									<li>Bio section for all Venmo profiles</li> 
								</ul>
								<br>
								<h4>Additional Questions</h4>
								<p>During a wrap up meeting questioned in which ways could we improve our product.</p>
								<ul> 
									<li>How does switching between a personal account and charity accounts enable trust between donors and charities regarding the management of funds?</li> 
									<li>Can we provide analytics that provide a holistic understanding of the funds raised, and what does effective charity analytics look like? </li>
									<li>Can we connect the world in a deeper way by developing a platform where we are enabling a greater sense of giving and responsibility than we are already doing?</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
								<h4>What I learned</h4>	
								<p> Beyond the questions I had I also was left a greater understanding of the UX process and where I could grow.</p>
								<ul> 
									<li>Your teammates are a wealth of information and they present daily learning opportunities.</li>
									<li>Mapping a concrete user flow is vital to speed when creating wireframes.</li>
									<li>Testing as early as possible helps validate the weakest held assumptions and enables quick iteration.</li> 
									<li>Create tests that develop a scenario the user can embody, and ask open ended questions.</li>
									<li>Documentation of the entire process, interviews, affinity maps, and competitive analysis is extremely important.</li>
								</ul>
