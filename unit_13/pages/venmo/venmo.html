					<h3> Background </h3>
					<figure class="col8">
						<h4>The Problem</h4>
						<p>Venmo is looking to introduce a way for users to donate to causes they care about. Charities need a simple way to engage with donors.</p>
					</figure>
					<figure class="col6">
						<div class="imagewrapper">
							<img src="images/1.png" alt="image of abstract art" title="Brick wall" class="imagewrapper">
						</div>
						<h4>Team</h4>
						<p>This was a mock client project as a part of General Assembly User Experience Design Immersive. As a team of four designers we conduct interviews, developed insights, mapped the user journey, and created affinity maps together.</p>
						<h4>Role</h4>
						<p>I led the ideation, wire framing, creation of high-fidelity mockups, and usability testing portions of the project.</p>
						<h4>Time Frame</h4>
						<p> We used an agile framework as we worked together through a ten day sprint. Each day started with a standup as a way to reduce barriers and share knowledge and ended with a recap of the days activities as a way to communicate progress.</p>

						<h3> The Challenge </h3>
						<div class="clearfix">
							<figure class="col8">
								<h4>Project Beginnings</h4>
								<p>We initially asked, “In what way can Venmo authentically add a charity feature for donations?” We experienced a moment of clarity when we read Venmo’s mission statement, “Connecting and empowering the world through payments.“ This statement is painted on the walls of the Venmo office and became the point of convergence for our team.</p>
								<br>
							</figure>
							<figure class="col6">
								<img src="images/2.png" alt="image of the Golden Circle" title="Golden Circle" class="imagewrapper">
								<h4>The Golden Circle</h4>
								<p>We discovered that through inserting charities into the flow we can beneficially expand the users that Venmo connects, by empowering more people through payments and donations. For Venmo this presented an opportunity to support philanthropy, raise brand awareness, and grow their user base.</p>
								<h4>Crowdfunding</h4>
								<p> This shows the growth in crowdfunding giving between 2012 and 2015.<a href="http://crowdexpert.com/crowdfunding-industry-statistics/">(Source)</a></p>
								<div class="imagewrapper">
									<img src="images/3.png" alt="Millenial Giving Chart" title="chart" class="imagewrapper">
									<h4>Charitable Giving Statistics</h4>
									<p> We found that, "in a survey of more than 1,500 employed millennials, 87 percent had donated money to a nonprofit in the last year, 62 percent said they had done that through a mobile platform and learned about those charities via their peers." It seemed that supporting causes through Venmo was a natural market from looking at these reports.<a href="http://cdn.trustedpartner.com/docs/library/AchieveMCON2013/MIR_2014.pdf"> (Source)</a></p>

					<h3> Research </h3>
					<div class="clearfix">
						<figure class="col8">
							<h4>Approach</h4>
							<p>We wanted to understand how the current charitable donation market is positioned as well as how people are currently donating. We also wanted to know how people are using Venmo and how charitable organizations are colllecting money. So we approached our research through identifying several channels: We did a competitive market analysis, and an anaylsis of other chartiable donation platforms. Additionally we looked at companies that are rating charities and companies that are assigning credibility through the charities they promote. Finally we conducted interviews with Venmo users, donors, and charities to gain insights about their process.</p>
						</figure>
					</div>
					<div class="clearfix">
						<figure class="col2">
							<div class="columntext">
								<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
								<p>We looked at three of the top competitors and analyzed who their users were, including Venmo’s parent company: Paypal. We learned that Venmo users are social spenders. Social spenders are people who occasionally spend or transfer money between friends in small amounts. We found that Venmo has a defined position in the arena of small transactions under $300.</p>
							</div>	
						</figure>
						<figure class="col5">
							<div class="imagewrapper">
								<img src="images/6.png" alt="image of abstract art" title="Brick wall" class="imagewrapper">
								<p> This model helped us understand who charities would be targeting. We believed that charities could expand their network and leverage the social nature of Venmo by tapping into the intimate relationships that connect most users.</p>
							</div>
						</figure>
					</div>
					<div class="clearfix">
						<figure class="col2">
							<div class="columntext">
								<h4>Charitable Donation Platforms</h4>
								<p>We looked at other crowdfunding platforms to understand what they are doing correctly and how they are doing it. We saw that companies like Kickstarter and GoFundMe are using social networks to attract people to their site. Additionally we saw that the social nature of these sites help entice and engage a larger user base.</p>
							</div>	
						</figure>
						<figure class="col5">
							<div class="imagewrapper">
								<img src="images/6.2.png" alt="image of abstract art" title="Brick wall" class="imagewrapper">
								<p>These platforms are the two largest crowdfunding sites. Gofundme primarily is used for informal charitable donations. Informal donations are donation between two people</p>
							</div>
						</figure>
					</div>
					<div class="clearfix">
						<figure class="col2">
							<div class="columntext">	
								<h4>Credibility</h4>
								<p> The key elements that platforms are considering is credibility. We noticed that each plaform is acting differently. But we were able to take away that trust was an important factor when determining who to donate to. These websites rate charities and their effectivness. These platforms were verifying charities via a 501 (C)(3) status and an EIN number.</p>
							</div>	
						</figure>
						<figure class="col5">
							<div class="imagewrapper">
								<img src="images/6.3.png" alt="image of abstract art" title="Brick wall" class="imagewrapper">
								<p>These platforms were the main crowdfunding sites.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="clearfix">
						<figure class="col5">
							<div class="imagewrapper">
								<img src="images/7.png" alt="image of abstract art" title="Brick wall" class="imagewrapper">
								<p>We conducted 9 interviews with Venmo users, occasional donors, and employees at charitable organizations. Some Venmo users were donors and some donors also worked for charities. But, we interviewed no charities that were using Venmo as a platform to collect funds.</p>
							</div>
						</figure>
						<figure class="col2">
							<div class="columntext">	
								<h4>5E Framework</h4>
								<p> To explain our findings we mapped one user journey from each group of interview groups</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Entice: How do you get interested?</li>
									<li>Enter: How do you start?</li>
									<li>Engage: What’s the process?</li>
									<li>Exit: How does it end?</li>
									<li>Extend: How do you remember it? How do you continue the relationship?</li>

								<h4>Venmo User: Sean</h4>
								<p>Sean is satisfied with the current Venmo experience. For Sean, Venmo is so easy he has replaced conventional currency for transactions between friends. When hanging out with his friends he no longer has to worry about having enough cash. His trust in Venmo is based off of trust in his friendships.</p>

								<h4>Donor: Shannon</h4>
								<p>Shannon, like other donors doesn’t seek out donation opportunities on her own. She doesn’t mind making a contribution when there is an opportunity in front of her and she feels best when she is able to discern where her funds are going. Shannon seeks transparency throughout the donation process. </p>

						<figure class="col5">
							<div class="imagewrapper">
								<img src="images/9.png" alt="image of abstract art" title="Brick wall" class="imagewrapper">
								<p>How donors were enticed in became important as we moved forward. For Shannon, donating means knowing what the cause is that she is supporting, knowing where her money will go, and knowing how she will affect change.</p>

							<h4>Charitable Organization Employee: Schoen</h4>
							<p>Schoen is the head of development at Collaboraction a local Chicago chartiy. She utilizes the social networks of current members to seek potential new donors. Gathering contact information is a priority over an initial donation. For Collaboraction furthering the relationship through engagement and involvement will lead to more sustained giving.</p>

						<figure class="col5">

							<h4>Comparing the Experience</h4>
							<p>By comparing the Venmo experience and the donation experience we found similarities between how people enter, engage, and exit. Interestingly the donation process provides stronger enticement then the current Venmo expereince, as well as charities provide a stronger extension of the relationship with their users.</p>

							<h4>Tieing It Together</h4>

							<h4>The Ideal Donor Experience</h4>

							<h4>The Ideal Charity Experience</h4>
							<br>
							<p>Setting up a charity account needs to be as simple as setting up a personal account. Charities can create their own causes based on their current fundraising effort. They can share their cause or account information to social media or prompt donors in person to donate via the Venmo app.</p>

				<h3>Design Iterations</h3>

					<figure class="col8">
						<h4>Mimicking</h4>
						<p>We started our paper prototypes by mimicking the Venmo layout. Since we determined staying consistent was important we needed to get a good sense of how the app was laid out. The paper sketches gave us a great sense of the features Venmo was already using but it didnt help us test our own features because of the specificity of the icons. We started to realize small tweaks with a big impact was going to be difficult.</p>

						<h4>Test Results</h4>
						<p> Our usability tests solved user flow issues and provided a guiding direction. We struggled with a two flow solution (when testing with charities and testing with venmo users), and learned that if we are going to test two user flows we needed to completely seperate those flows and screens. This was probably the biggest struggle within the project and this cost us the most amount of time.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Users responded very positively to the heart badge because it was consistent with other verification badges.</li>
							<li>Users commented on the consistency of the Venmo experience, and how it was similar to the Venmo experiences they currently know</li>
							<li>Users responded very poorly to being asked if they would like to be contacted by the charity.</li>
							<li>We had initially assumed that searching for a charity would happen within the same flow as the "search people" but without a search charity icon in the menu button people were confused on how to look for a charity.</li>

							<h4>A Second Sprint</h4>
							<p>After completing the ten day sprint we took our prototype over to the Delta Institute to validate our research further. We allowed charity organizers to play around with the prototype. We got feedback that showed a second design sprint was needed. The charity organizers discussed having the ability to switch from their own personal account to a charity account they are managing. We had discussed this early on as a way to reduce barriers for the charitable organizations.</p>

							 <p>We took this feedback and developed a list of additional features that would reduce barriers, increase trust, and facilitate relationships</p>
							<br>
							<h4>Additional Features</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Data report feature</li>
								<li>Group feature / charity feature integration</li>
								<li>Profile management / switching between a personal account and a charity account</li>
								<li>Personal account- causes feature</li>
								<li>Bio section for all Venmo profiles</li> 
							</ul>

							<h4>Additional Questions</h4>
							<p>During a wrap up meeting questioned in which ways could we improve our product.</p>
							<ul> 
								<li>How does switching between a personal account and charity accounts enable trust between donors and charities regarding the management of funds?</li> 
								<li>Can we provide analytics that provide a wholistic understanding of the funds raised, and what does effective charity analytics look like? </li>
								<li>Can we connect the world in a deeper way by developing a platform where we are enabling a greater sense of giving and responsibility than we are already doing?</li>
							</ul>

							<h4>Things I learned</h4>	
							<p> Beyond the questions I had I also was left a greater understanding of the UX process and where I could grow.</p>
							<ul> 
								<li>Your teamates are a wealth of information and they present daily learning opportunities.</li>
								<li>Mapping a concrete user flow is vital to speed when creating wireframes.</li>
								<li>Testing as early as possible helps validate the weakest held assumptions and enables quick iteration.</li> 
								<li>Create tests that develop a scenario the user can embody, and ask open ended questions.</li>
								<li>Documentation of the entire process, iterviews, affinity maps, and competitive anaylsis is extremely important.</li>
							</ul>
