								<h4>The Original Problem</h4>
								<p>Crafty Delivers a rapidly growing startup offering kegerators and breakroom solutions was looking to create a new format for their online marketplace as they expanded into new sales categories. Additionally Crafty was looking to expose their events and full service kitchen program to their marketplace customers.</p>
							</figure>
							<img src="images/0.0.png" alt="image time frame" title="time frame" class="imagewrapper">
							<figure class="col6">
								<h4>Time Frame</h4>
								<p>We used an agile framework over the course of a three-week design sprint. Each day started with a standup to reduce barriers and share knowledge and ended with a recap of the day’s activities to communicate progress. We met with the Crafty team half way through the project to present our research and discuss deliverables.</p>
									<img src="images/0.png" alt="image time frame" title="time frame" class="imagewrapper">
								<h4>Team and Role</h4>
								<p>The Crafty delivers project was the final project as a part of General Assembly User Experience Design Immersive. As a team of four designers we conduct interviews, did competitive analysis, developed insights, mapped user journeys, and created affinity maps together. I co-led the communication strategy, wire framing, creation of high-fidelity mockups, and competitive analysis portions of the project. I was responsible for creating a style guide and designing workshops.</p>

									<img src="images/1.png" alt="image of team" title="team picture" class="imagewrapper">
								</div>
								<h4>Crafty Background</h4>
								<p>Crafty Delivers is about two years old. They started by providing kegs and craft beer to offices and quickly expanded to provide full breakroom solutions, events, and equipment maintenance. Crafty's four main pillars are:</p>
								<div class="imagewrapper">
									<img src="images/3.png" alt="image of team" title="team picture" class="imagewrapper">
								</div>
								<h4>Project Beginning and Reframe</h4>
								<p>Since Crafty was expanding their offerings so rapidly they hadn’t been able to consider an online or in person growth strategy. Their co-founders were finding themselves texting daily with multiple clients to offer great customer service but the team needed a way to streamline. From our initial interview with the Crafty team we understood that they were experiencing growing pains. We realized we were going to have to deliver much more than a new marketplace solution and that whatever solution we provided it needed to include a roadmap of how to grow in the future.

							<h3> Research </h3>
						</div>
						<div class="clearfix">
							<figure class="col8">
								<h4>Research Approach</h4>
								<p>We wanted to understand the current ecosystem surrounding Crafty, their competition, workplace culture, and the companies Crafty provides services to. We identified several channels for research deliverables: A competitive market analysis, an analysis of Crafy's categorization, a review of their website, and an understanding of why Crafty provides these services. Finally, we conducted interviews with office managers and stakeholders to gain insights about their process of buying and receiving orders.</p>
							</figure>
						</div>
						<div class="clearfix">
							<figure class="col2">
								<div class="columntext">
									<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
									<p>Of the companies we interviewed many were using delivery services prior to turning to Crafty. They left because of problems with ordering, and having to turn to multiple vendors for supplies. Since office managers are looking to provide holistic solutions for their companies turning to multiple vendors is difficult. Full service competition is large national and global companies offering one size fits all solutions. These companies struggle to provide unique options and intimate services.</p>

									<h4>Crafty Research</h4>
									<p>Crafty employees were making decisions on the fly and the solutions they were offering were to patch immediate leaks. Many of their employees had only been working for Crafty for four months and every employee was providing a customer service support role through text, email, or Slack. The mentality throughout Crafty was say yes to any request and then figure out how to accomplish the task later.</p>

									<h4>Crafty Website</h4>
									<p>The Crafty online marketplace had some immediately evident problems:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Multiple options to search and refine by type.</li>
										<li>Searches results that display no findings.</li>
										<li>Multiple tabs that silo the search of beer, coffee, and wine kegs.</li>
										<li>A shopping cart with high pagination.</li>
										<li>A changing daily menu of over 1000 items.</li>
									</ul>

									<h4>Crafty Golden Circle</h4>
									<p>To engage Crafty in our first meeting we had them compose their “Golden Circle”. The Golden circle is a device used for companies to define their purpose and the reason their organization exists. This activity helped Crafty to define the service they were providing. For Crafty helping office managers create a cohesive office space through seamless facilitation was integral but they also isolated that office retention is what they were ultimately providing to offices.</p>

									<h4>An Era Analysis - A history of the office.</h4>
									<p>We created an era analysis for Crafty to show how they fit within the history of the office. Based on the offices we visited with the multiple movie theatres and fully stocked snack bars it makes sense that many people are coining the current era as “The Age of Experience.” We found that Crafty’s competitive advantage isn’t their ability to sell beer it is about making an experience something you want to be a part of.</p>

									<h4>Office Manager Interviews</h4>
									<img src="images/8.png" alt="image of interview participants" title="interview subjects" class="imagewrapper">
									<p>We conducted five user interviews with office managers. Four office managers are currently using Crafty to deliver Kegs and snacks and one office manager is using Binny’s for beer orders and Instacart for snacks. We were specifically looking for Marketplace customers of mid-size companies between 100 to 200 employees who were placing orders more than twice a month. Additionally, we were looking for companies who were unsatisfied with the service Crafty provided</p>
							</figure>
							<figure class="col8">
								<div class="columntext">	
									<h4>The Journey Map</h4>
									<p> To explain our findings, we had every office manager map their user journey from before they started the office ordering process to the time they received the products they ordered. We had office managers list each step of the process and then we gave the process a numerical ranking based on how enjoyable or unenjoyable the task was (-3 to +3). The journey maps helped us to find the pain points in the ordering process and determine areas of improvement specifically on the website.</p>

									<h4>Key Insights from the User Journey</h4>
									<p>As we were interviewing Crafty customers we found that across the board customers were extremely satisfied with the service Crafty was providing. But as we looked deeper into their journeys we noticed that almost every user was using “Control F” to find the items they were looking for. The bulk of the problems stemmed from a concern of being removed from the ordering process, the manual search function, or the multiple pagination problem when viewing orders. Notice that this user struggles with the ordering process but she is very complimentary of Crafty’s customer service.</p>

							<h3> Insights</h3>
						<div class="clearfix">
							<figure class="col6">
									<h4>Office Managers Insights</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Every office manager has unique need’s they are trying to fill for their office. One office was very concerned about making sure they order enough flavor blasted goldfish.</li>
										<li>Office managers order some new items each week but for the most part their orders stay consistent. – For example, one office was providing the same kombucha to their office with every order they made, but ordered a different beer each time.</li>
										<li>Office managers were not concerned with their ordering decisions but almost every office was doing some sort of informal office polls to understand what their employees wanted when ordering beer.</li> 
										<li>Office managers seek organizational opportunities and struggle with decision fatigue specifically when tasked with selecting services and amenities.</li> 
										<li>Customers continue to shop with Crafty based on the amazing customer service and because their individual needs are being met. One office manager was only ever completing about half her order and then following up with Crafty with the rest of her order.</li>
										<li>Office managers were extremely protective over the Crafty voice that was used throughout their emails and messaging and were concerned it may change. Multiple office managers informed us that they look forward to the newsletter that Crafty sends out.</li>
										<li>Companies are looking to align their office values with the values of their vendors.</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
									<h4>Crafty Insights</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Crafty built their brand through personalized connections and face to face relationships. As they expand, they will have less face to face touch points with their customers.</li>
										<li>Crafty is making decisions on the fly without an understanding of why they are making those decisions. We saw this when we initially brought up the curling paper on the kegs and they instantly said, “lets but frames as soon as we get back to the office.”</li>
										<li>Crafty is providing a valuable service but they are not influencing the experiences they help create. This was especially true within the offices that we visited and the kegerators that Crafty was supplying. In many of the offices the kegerator had a paper sign with the description of the beer. But in many cases this sign was curling from the beer that had spilled on the sign.</li>

							<figure class="col8">
								<h4>Tying It Together</h4>
								<p>We mined our affinity maps, user flows, and insights to see where there were opportunities. We knew Crafty office managers were extremely happy with the customer service but there were areas of growth in the way Crafty provides service and through the website.</p>

								<h4>Solutions should...</h4>
								<br>
								<img src="images/11.png" alt="the ideal donor journey" title="5 e chart" class="imagewrapper">
								<br>
								<h4>Communication Strategy.</h4>
								<p>We realized that Crafty needed a way to make decisions moving forward. We produced a series of cards with our overarching themes that could be used as a lens to help focus idea generation. The cards were asking Crafty to leverage the craft experience, help personalize connections, and align their business with the company culture of their clients. Each card had a sub topic to further explain. On the cover card, we gave Crafty a “round robin.” idea generator designed to help them focus their ideas.</p>
								<h4>Leverage the Craft Experience</h4>
								<p>Crafty is offering a very unique office experience and they need to take advantage of it! Crafty should consider how to leverage user interactions to reflect the Crafty experience.</p>
								<img src="images/12.png" alt="communication card" title="leverage experience" class="imagewrapper">
								<h4>Personalize Connections</h4>
								<p>Offce managers love the Crafty Experience! They love Crafty because the have given their clients individual attention. This personal relationship needs to remain as Crafty grows.</p>
								<img src="images/13.png" alt="communication card" title="personalize connections" class="imagewrapper">
								<h4>Align with Company Culture</h4>
								<p>Every company has unique employees and culture. What is popular with one company might not work with another. Crafty must consider how to fit within their client’s company.</p>

								<h4>Small Tweaks Big Impact</h4>
								<p>To stay consistent with the current Venmo layout our paper prototypes needed to mimic the layout exactly. The paper sketches helped us understand the features Venmo was already using but it did not help us in testing because of the specificity of the icons we were trying to implement. We started to realize small tweaks with a big impact was going to be difficult.</p>
