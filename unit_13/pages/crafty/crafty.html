							<h4>The Problem</h4>
							<p>Crafty Delivers a rapidly growing startup offering kegerators and break room solutions was experiencing growing pains and making spontaneous decisions at every turn. Crafty was looking for a streamlined format for their online marketplace so their co-founders could focus beyond personalized customer service. Through interviews, research, and workshops we provided a future roadmap, a full website redesign, and a framework for making decisions.</p>
						</figure>

						<figure class="col6">
							<h4>Time Frame</h4>
							<img src="images/0.png" alt="image time frame" title="time frame" class="imagewrapper">
							<p>We used an agile framework over the course of a three-week design sprint.</p>
							<br>
							<h4>Crafty Background</h4>
							<div class="imagewrapper">
								<img src="images/3.png" alt="image of team" title="team picture" class="imagewrapper">
							</div>
							<p>Crafty Delivers has quickly expanded to provide a wide variety of food and drinks on demand, full service breakroom solutions, office happy hours, and kitchen equipment maintenance.</p>
							<br>
							<h4>Team and Role</h4>
							<p>The Crafty delivers project was the final project as a part of General Assembly User Experience Design Immersive. I co-led the communication strategy, wire framing, creation of high-fidelity mockups, and competitive analysis portions of the project.</p>

						<h3>Research</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="clearfix">
						<figure class="col8">
							<h4>Research Approach</h4>
							<p>We wanted to understand the current ecosystem surrounding Crafty, their competition, workplace culture, and the companies Crafty provides services to. We interviewed office managers and stakeholders to gain insights about their process of buying and receiving orders.</p>
						</figure>
					</div>
					<div class="clearfix">
						<figure class="col2">
							<div class="columntext">	
								<h4>Crafty Research</h4>
								<p>Crafty employees were making decisions on the fly and the solutions they were offering were to patch immediate leaks. Many of their employees had only been working for Crafty for four months and every employee was providing a customer service support role through text, email, or Slack. The mentality throughout Crafty was say yes to any request and then figure out how to accomplish the task later.</p>

								<h4>Crafty Website</h4>
								<p>The Crafty online marketplace had some immediately evident problems:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Multiple options to search and refine by type.</li>
									<li>Searches results that display no findings.</li>
									<li>Multiple tabs that silo the search of beer, coffee, and wine kegs.</li>
									<li>A shopping cart with high pagination.</li>
									<li>A changing daily menu of over 1000 items.</li>

								<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
								<p>Many companies were using delivery services prior to turning to Crafty. They left because of problems with ordering, and having to turn to multiple vendors for supplies. Since office managers are looking to provide holistic solutions for their companies turning to multiple vendors is difficult. Full service competition is large companies offering one size fits all solutions. These companies struggle to provide unique options and intimate services.</p>

						<figure class="col5">
							<div class="imagewrapper">

								<h4>Crafty Golden Circle</h4>
								<p>To engage Crafty in our first meeting we had them compose their “Golden Circle”. This activity helped Crafty to define the service they were providing. For Crafty helping office managers create a cohesive office space through seamless facilitation was integral. The Crafty team dug deep and isolated that office retention is what they were helping to provide to offices.</p>

								<h4>An Era Analysis - A history of the office.</h4>
								<p>We created an era analysis for Crafty to show how they fit within the history of the office. Based on the offices we visited with the multiple movie theatres and fully stocked snack bars it makes sense that many people are coining the current era as “The Age of Experience.” We found that Crafty’s competitive advantage isn’t their ability to sell beer it is about making an experience something you want to be a part of.</p>

							<h4>Office Manager Interviews</h4>
							<img src="images/8.png" alt="image of interview participants" title="interview subjects" class="imagewrapper">
							<p>We conducted five user interviews with office managers of mid-size companies between 100 to 200 employees who were placing orders more than twice a month. Additionally, we were looking for companies who were unsatisfied with the service Crafty provided.</p>

						<figure class="col8">
							<div class="columntext">	
								<h4>The Journey Map</h4>
								<p>We had office managers map their journey from before they started the office ordering process to the time they received the products. The journey maps helped us to find the pain points in the ordering process and determine areas of improvement specifically on the website.</p>

								<h4>Key Insights from the User Journey</h4>
								<p> Throughout our interviews the users struggled with the ordering process but were very complimentary of Crafty’s customer service. The bulk of the problems stemmed from having to manually search for items and multiple pagination when reviewing orders.</p>

							<figure class="col6">
								<h4>Tying It Together</h4>
								<p>We knew office managers were extremely happy with the Crafty customer service but any decisions Crafty made moving forward needed to use the website like an employee.</p>
								<br>	
								<h4>Solutions should...</h4>
								<br>
								<img src="images/11.png" alt="the ideal donor journey" title="5 e chart" class="imagewrapper">
								<br>
								<h4>...Guide Decisions</h4>
								<p> We produced a series of cards with guiding principles that could be used as a lens to help focus idea generation. The cards helped Crafty "leverage the craft experience", "personalize connections", and "align their business" with the culture of their clients. On the cover card, we gave Crafty a “round robin.” to help them focus and generate their ideas.</p>
								<img src="images/10.jpg" alt="affinity map" title="icon" class="projectimage">
								<br>
								<br>
								<h4>...Leverage the Craft Experience</h4>
								<p>Crafty is offering a unique office experience and they should leverage user interactions to reflect the Crafty experience.</p>
								<img src="images/12.png" alt="communication card" title="leverage experience" class="imagewrapper">
								<h4>...Personalize Connections</h4>
								<p>Office managers love the Crafty experience because they have given their clients individual attention. This personal relationship needs to remain as Crafty grows.</p>
								<img src="images/13.png" alt="communication card" title="personalize connections" class="imagewrapper">
								<h4>...Align with Company Culture</h4>
								<p>Crafty must consider how to fit within their client’s unique employees and company culture.</p>

								<h4>Main Website Changes</h4>
								<p>Maintaining the Crafty look and feel was important to their clients so we used Crafty's style guide as a starting point. Since existing customers enter directly into the marketplace the homepage needed to communicate the offerings to new customers.</p>

								<h4>What I Learned</h4>	
								<p>Working with a client like Crafty allowed us to provide the best possible solution because of their willingness to let us provide value. If I was to do this project over again I would:</p>
