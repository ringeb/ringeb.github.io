								<h4>The Original Problem</h4>
								<p>Crafty Delivers a rapidly growing startup offering kegerators and breakroom solutions was looking to redo their online marketplace as they expanded into new sales categories. Since Crafty was expanding their offerings so rapidly they hadn’t been able to consider an online or in person growth strategy. Their co-founders were finding themselves texting daily with multiple clients to offer great customer service but the team needed a way to streamline.</p>
							</figure>
							<figure class="col6">
								<h4>Time Frame</h4>
								<p>We used an agile framework over the course of a three-week design sprint. Each day started with a standup to reduce barriers and share knowledge and ended with a recap of the day’s activities to communicate progress. We met with the Crafty team half way through the project to present our research and discuss deliverables.</p>
								<div class="imagewrapper">
									<img src="images/1_1.png" alt="image of abstract art" title="Brick wall" class="imagewrapper">
								</div>
								<h4>Team and Role</h4>
								<p>The Crafty delivers project was the final project as a part of General Assembly User Experience Design Immersive. As a team of four designers we conduct interviews, did competitive analysis, developed insights, mapped user journeys, and created affinity maps together. I co-led the communication strategy, wire framing, creation of high-fidelity mockups, and competitive analysis portions of the project. I also was responsible for creating a style guide and designing and facilitating a workshop.</p>

								<h4>Crafty Background</h4>
								<p>Crafty Delivers is about two years old. They started by providing kegs and craft beer to offices and quickly expanded to provide full breakroom solutions, events and kitchen equipment maintenance. Crafty four main pillars currently are:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Online Marketplace</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Kegs, bottles, and cases of beer, wine, cider, coffee, and tea.</li>
											<li>Expanding snacks and food selection.</li>
											<li>Expanding dairy selection.</li>
											<li>Expanding supplies section of cleaning supplies and tablewares.</li>
										</ul>
									<li>Kitchen Program</li>
										<ul>
											<li> Full breakroom solution with a staffed operator to clean and restock food and drinks.</li>
											<li></li>
										</ul>
									<li>Events Program</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Full event services from bars, kegs, bartenders, onsite event facilitation, and event cleanup services.</li>
											<li></li>
										</ul>
									<li>Crafty Cares (Keg Care)</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Keg Maitenance.</li>
											<li></li>
										</ul>			

								</ul>
								<h4>Project Beginning and Reframe</h4>
								<p>We initially asked, “In what way can Venmo authentically add a charity feature for donations?” We experienced a moment of clarity when we read Venmo’s mission statement, “Connecting and empowering the world through payments.“ We discovered that through inserting charities into the flow we can beneficially expand the users that Venmo connects, by empowering more people through payments and donations. For Venmo this presented an opportunity to support philanthropy, raise brand awareness, and grow their user base.</p>
								<br>
								<img src="images/2.png" alt="image of the Golden Circle" title="Golden Circle" class="imagewrapper">
									<h4>Charitable Giving Statistics</h4>
									<p>From looking at reports it seemed that supporting causes through Venmo was a natural fit. The clear majority of Venmo users were millennials using Venmo to settle small balances between friends. Additionally, most millennials who had donated to charities did so from mobile platforms. They learned about those charities via their peers.<a href="http://cdn.trustedpartner.com/docs/library/AchieveMCON2013/MIR_2014.pdf">(Millenial Giving).</a> So a social payment application between friends such as Venmo was primed to help make the donation connection.<a href="https://www.blackbaud.com/nonprofit-resources/generational-giving-report-infographic">(Generational Giving Statistics)</a><a href="http://crowdexpert.com/crowdfunding-industry-statistics/">(Crowdfunding Industry Statistics)</a></p>

						</div>
						<div class="clearfix">
							<figure class="col8">
								<h4>Research Approach</h4>
								<p>We wanted to understand the current ecosystem surrounding Crafty, their competition, workplace culture, and the companies they provide services to. We approached our research through identifying several channels: We did a competitive market analysis, an analysis of other charitable donation platforms and a review of companies that are rating and assigning credibility to charitable organizations. Finally, we conducted interviews with office managers, to gain insights about their process of spending and collecting money.</p>

								<div class="columntext">
									<h4>Delivery Services</h4>
									<p>Many of the companies we spoke with were using Binnys, Instacart, and Minibar Chicago, prior to turning to Crafty. They decided to leave because of problems with ordering, and having to turn to multiple vendors for supplies. Since office managers are looking to provide holistic solutions for their companies turning to multiple vendors was becoming tricky.</p>

									<p>Companies that are providing full service solutions like Crafty’s kitchen program have been around since the 1960’s and are usually national and global companies offering one size fits all solutions.

									<h4>Interview Numbers</h4>
									<p>We conducted 9 interviews with Venmo users, traditional charitable donors, and employees at charitable organizations. Some Venmo users were donors and some donors also worked for charities. We did interview several charitable organizations but we discovered there wasn't an overlap between charitable organizations that were using Venmo as a platform to collect funds.</p>

									<h4>The 5E's Framework</h4>
									<p> To explain our findings, we mapped one user journey from each of our interview groups to a 5E's map. The 5E's map helped us to discover the similarities and differences between the groups. The 5E's are:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Entice: How does someone get interested in going through a process?</li>
										<li>Enter: How does someone get start in that process?</li>
										<li>Engage: What happens during the process?</li>
										<li>Exit: How does the process end?</li>
										<li>Extend: How does someone remember and continue the relationship with the process?</li>

									<h4>Traditional Venmo User: Sean</h4>
									<p>Sean is satisfied with the current Venmo experience. For Sean, Venmo is so easy he has replaced conventional currency for transactions between friends. When hanging out with his friends he no longer must worry about having enough cash. His trust in Venmo is based off trust in his friendships.</p>

									<h4>Traditional Charity Donor: Shannon</h4>
									<p> Shannon, like other donors doesn’t seek out donation opportunities on her own. She doesn’t mind contributing when there is an opportunity in front of her and she feels best when she can discern where her funds are going. Shannon seeks transparency throughout the donation process.</p>

							</figure>
							<figure class="col5">
								<div class="imagewrapper">

									<h4>Charitable Organization Employee: Schoen</h4>
									<p>Schoen is the head of development at Collaboraction a local Chicago charity. She utilizes the social networks of current members to seek potential new donors. Gathering contact information is a priority over an initial donation. For Collaboraction furthering the relationship through engagement and involvement will lead to more sustained giving.</p>

							<h3> Insights</h3>

							<figure class="col6">
								<div class="columntext">
									<h4>Comparing the Experience</h4>
									<p>By comparing the Venmo experience and the donation experience we found similarities between how people enter, engage, and exit. Interestingly the donation process provides stronger enticement then the current Venmo experience, as well as charities provide a stronger extension of the relationship with their users.</p>
								</div>	
								<div class="imagewrapper">
									<img src="images/11.png" alt="image of abstract art" title="Brick wall" class="imagewrapper">
								</div>
										<h4>Venmo User Insights</h4>
										<p>We discovered that Venmo users seek convenience, value trust, and generally enjoy the Venmo experience.</p>
										<h4>Charitable Donor Insights</h4>	
										<p>We found that traditional donors find many barriers to action in the donation process. Donors were encouraged to donate when there was a level of transparency about the organization they were donating to and when they were emotionally tied to the cause or could empathize with the need.</p>
										<h4>Charitable Organization Insights</h4>
										<p>In our interviews, charitable organizations were seeking relationships with new donors sometimes over an initial donation. These organizations wanted to expand through their already built social network and were seeking new opportunities for engagement around those networks.</p>

								<h4>Small Tweaks Big Impact</h4>
								<p>To stay consistent with the current Venmo layout our paper prototypes needed to mimic the layout exactly.

									<li>Users commented on the consistency of the Venmo experience, and how it was similar to the Venmo experiences they currently know</li>
									<li>Users responded very poorly to being asked if they would like to be contacted by the charity.</li>
									<li>We had initially assumed that searching for a charity would happen within the same flow as the "search people" but without a search charity icon in the menu button people were confused on how to look for a charity.</li>

								<h4>A Second Sprint</h4>
								<p>After completing the ten day sprint we took our prototype over to the Delta Institute to validate our assumptions further. We allowed charity organizers to play around with the prototype. We got feedback that showed a second design sprint was needed. The charity organizers discussed having the ability to switch from their own personal account to a charity account they are managing. An account switching feature would reduce barriers for the charitable organizations. We took our feedback and developed a list of additional features that would reduce barriers, increase trust, and facilitate relationships</p>
								<br>
								<h4>Additional Features</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Data report feature</li>
									<li>Group feature / charity feature integration</li>
									<li>Profile management / switching between a personal account and a charity account</li>
									<li>Personal account- causes feature</li>
									<li>Bio section for all Venmo profiles</li> 
								</ul>
								<br>
								<h4>Additional Questions</h4>
								<p>During a wrap up meeting questioned in which ways could we improve our product.</p>
								<ul> 
									<li>How does switching between a personal account and charity accounts enable trust between donors and charities regarding the management of funds?</li> 
									<li>Can we provide analytics that provide a holistic understanding of the funds raised, and what does effective charity analytics look like? </li>
									<li>Can we connect the world in a deeper way by developing a platform where we are enabling a greater sense of giving and responsibility than we are already doing?</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
								<h4>What I learned</h4>	
								<p> Beyond the questions I had I also was left a greater understanding of the UX process and where I could grow.</p>
								<ul> 
									<li>Your teammates are a wealth of information and they present daily learning opportunities.</li>
									<li>Mapping a concrete user flow is vital to speed when creating wireframes.</li>
									<li>Testing as early as possible helps validate the weakest held assumptions and enables quick iteration.</li> 
									<li>Create tests that develop a scenario the user can embody, and ask open ended questions.</li>
									<li>Documentation of the entire process, interviews, affinity maps, and competitive analysis is extremely important.</li>
								</ul>
